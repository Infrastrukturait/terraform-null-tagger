  "\n## Idea",
  "it is a terraform module that was created to maintain consistent names and tags for resources in our organization.",
  "\nWe really believe and love Open Source, We provide this module under [GNU General Public License v3](LICENSE.md) license, feel free to using it.",
  "\n## Usage",
  "It's recommended to use one `tagger` module for every unique resource of a given resource type.",
  "For example, if you have 10 instances, there should be 10 different labels.",
  "However, if you have multiple different kinds of resources (e.g. instances, security groups, file systems, and elastic ips), then they can all share the same label assuming they are 
logically related.\n"
